# Note: This example uses echo statements for demonstration.
# 
# To actually add labels, you would need to:
# 1. Use the GitHub API or an action like 'actions/github-script'
# 2. Have appropriate permissions (GITHUB_TOKEN)
# 3. Use proper API calls to add labels
#
# Example with github-script:
# - uses: actions/github-script@v6
#   with:
#     script: |
#       github.rest.issues.addLabels({
#         owner: context.repo.owner,
#         repo: context.repo.repo,
#         issue_number: context.issue.number,
#         labels: ['bug']
#       })
