- **Add visuals**: Diagrams, ASCII art for complex concepts

### Markdown Formatting

```markdown
# Main Heading (only one per file)
## Section Heading
### Subsection Heading

- Bullet points for lists
1. Numbered lists for sequences

**Bold** for emphasis
`code` for commands and code
```

### Code Examples

Always test your code examples:

```bash
# Good: Tested command with expected output
git log --oneline
# Output: abc123 Latest commit
```

```bash
# Bad: Untested or unclear
git something
```
